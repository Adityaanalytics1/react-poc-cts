First off make sure you have NODE installed in your system and VSCode also .


once you open the vscode 

create a folder : react_proj_cte ( anythg of ur choice)

then   cd react_proj_cte ( cd folder name)

once u r inside folder now create a react proj



1 ) npx create-react-app react-poc-cts ( npx create-react-app appli-name)
2 ) cd react-poc-cts ( cd appli-name)
3 ) once application is created the n replace the code with our code 
4 ) npm start (this will start the appli will automatically open in chrome once its loaded)

if u face any errors like some modules missing these might be modules

for react-router-dom module error : npm install -S react-router-dom
for axios module error : npm install axios
for bootstrap module error : npm install --save bootstrap@^4.0.0-alpha.6  react-bootstrap@^0.32.1


once u install them run it once again by terminating the current running application by command

ctrl+c then y 


once done run the application again 

npm start that should do to open the application up and running
